## Navigation Restructuring

1. **Merged Contact & Bookings pages**: Combined into a single "Contact" page with tabs:
   - "Contact Me" tab: Contains the contact form and information
   - "Book a Session" tab: Contains the booking form and calendar

   - "Testimonials" tab: Client reviews by category
   - "Journal" tab: Blog posts and client stories
   - "FAQ" tab: Common questions and answers

3. **URL Redirects**: Set up redirects to maintain backward compatibility:
   - `/bookings` → `/contact?tab=book`
   - `/journal` → `/experience?tab=journal`
   - `/journal/:slug` → `/experience?tab=journal`
