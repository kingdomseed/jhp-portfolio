## Technical Issues to Address

### Image Aspect Ratio Handling

The changes made to handle image aspect ratios in the gallery failed to work as expected. The current implementation using the image metadata generator script needs to be revisited. Potential solutions include:

1. Refining the metadata generation process to ensure accurate aspect ratio extraction
2. Implementing a fallback system for images without proper metadata
3. Exploring alternative approaches to responsive image display in the masonry grid
4. Adding manual aspect ratio controls for edge cases

This issue should be prioritized as it affects the visual presentation of the gallery, which is a core feature of a photography website.

### TidyCal API Integration Improvements

The TidyCal integration has been significantly improved with the following changes:

1. Fixed CORS issues by implementing server-side API routes
2. Created a proper client/server architecture for TidyCal API communication
3. Improved error handling and debugging for API requests
4. Removed "Discovery Call" as a service type (it's a post-selection screening call)
5. Enhanced the booking calendar component with better error states

These improvements provide a more robust and secure way to interact with the TidyCal API, avoiding CORS issues and improving the overall reliability of the booking system.
