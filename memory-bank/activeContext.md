## Current Focus: Gallery System Improvement

The primary focus of recent work has been redesigning and implementing an improved gallery system that properly handles image aspect ratios and provides a better user experience.

## Problem Statement

The previous gallery implementation had issues with image display:
- Fixed row heights that didn't respect image aspect ratios
- Inconsistent image presentation
- Image metadata was not being effectively utilized
- Limited customization options

## Solution Implemented

A new gallery system has been developed with the following components:

1. **Image Metadata Generator**
   - Script: `/scripts/generate-image-metadata.js`
   - Runs at build time to analyze all images in `/public/images/`
   - Calculates dimensions, aspect ratios, and orientation
   - Generates `/public/image-metadata.json`

2. **Enhanced MasonryGrid Component**
   - Component: `/components/ui/masonry-grid.tsx`
   - Implements a true masonry layout algorithm
   - Dynamically loads image metadata at runtime
   - Automatically adjusts to image aspect ratios
   - Provides fallbacks for images missing metadata
   - Responsive design with adaptive column counts

3. **Gallery Experience**
   - Page: `/app/galleries/page.tsx`
   - Categorized image management
   - Filtering by category
   - Multiple sort options
   - Lightbox integration for detailed viewing

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive documentation in `GALLERY-DOCUMENTATION.md`
   - Quick reference guide in `GALLERY-QUICK-REFERENCE.md`

## Current State

The gallery system is now functioning properly with:
- Correct aspect ratio handling for all images
- Visually appealing masonry layout
- Improved responsiveness across devices
- Better organization by category
- Enhanced user experience with filtering and sorting

## Recent Changes

1. **MasonryGrid Refactoring**
   - Implemented dynamic fetching of image metadata
   - Created a true masonry layout algorithm
   - Added smart fallbacks for missing metadata
   - Improved responsiveness

2. **Gallery UI Improvements**
   - Reduced spacing between images from 16px to 8px
   - Enhanced hover effects with image information
   - Added category badges and location information

3. **Metadata System**
   - Ensured metadata generation is automatic during builds
   - Added category-based fallbacks for better reliability

## Next Steps

The following improvements are planned for the gallery system:

1. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Add proper DialogTitle to lightbox for screen readers
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Ensure appropriate ARIA attributes

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize the 'sizes' attribute for Next.js Image components
   - Implement more sophisticated lazy loading
   - Improve initial load time for image-heavy pages

3. **SEO Improvements**
   - Add structured data with PhotoGallery schema
   - Implement OpenGraph metadata for gallery images
   - Create dynamic page titles and descriptions

4. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Consider implementing before/after editing examples
   - Add category descriptions
   - Create featured galleries for best work
   - Add location tagging and filtering

## Related Components

The gallery system interacts with these other components:
- **EnhancedLightbox**: For detailed image viewing
- **GalleryFilters**: For category filtering and sorting
- **Image Component**: For optimized image display
- **Build Process**: For metadata generation

## Technical Debt

Current areas of technical debt that need to be addressed:
- Some accessibility warnings in the console
- Image sizes optimization needed
- Need to improve error handling for missing images
- Better type safety for image metadata

## Decisions & Considerations

1. **Why Custom Masonry Implementation?**
   - Commercial masonry libraries often don't handle aspect ratios correctly
   - Greater control over the layout algorithm
   - Better integration with Next.js Image optimization
   - Custom hover effects and information display

2. **Metadata Approach**
   - Build-time generation was chosen for performance reasons
   - Runtime consumption provides flexibility
   - Fallback system ensures resilience

3. **Gallery Organization**
   - Category-based organization aligns with user mental models
   - Sort options provide flexibility in browsing
   - Lightbox integration creates immersive viewing experience
