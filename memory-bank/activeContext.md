# Jason Holt Photography Active Context

## Current Focus: Branding and Content Reorganization

The current focus has shifted to updating the website's branding, messaging, and content organization according to newly defined brand guidelines. Having completed the color scheme update, homepage service card revisions, and About page enhancements, we now need to continue aligning all text content and page structure with the refined brand identity that emphasizes "capturing life's journey" and celebrating all moments from newborns to weddings.

## Problem Statement

The previous website content has several issues that need to be addressed:
- Messaging doesn't fully capture the "life's journey" focus of the brand 
- Website structure doesn't align with the recommended navigation categories
- Inconsistent tone and voice across different pages
- CTAs are not strategically aligned with the new brand guidelines
- Gallery categorization doesn't reflect the key photography focus areas

## Solution Approach

A comprehensive branding and content update is being implemented with the following components:

1. **Brand Messaging Implementation**
   - Implement primary brand promise on desktop: "Capturing Your Life's Timeless Journey, One Moment at a Time."
   - Implement mobile tagline: "All Your Life's Moments, Celebrated."
   - Update all text content to reflect the "life's journey" theme
   - Ensure brand pillars (Authenticity, Celebration, Storytelling, Excellence, Relationship) are reflected in content

2. **Website Structure Reorganization**
   - Implement recommended navigation structure:
     - Home
     - About Jason (My Story, My Approach)
     - Portfolio (Families & Babies, Young Adults & Graduates, Couples & Engagements, Weddings & Celebrations, Professional & Corporate, Tailored Photography Experiences)
     - Client Experience (expectations, testimonials, FAQ)
     - Journal (blog, client stories)
     - Contact (with clear CTA)

   - Page-by-page review and revision
