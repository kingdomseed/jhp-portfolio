# Color Palette Exploration for Jason Holt Photography

This document explores various color palette options for the Jason Holt Photography website. The goal is to find a cohesive, professional color scheme that enhances the photography without competing with it, while resolving the current clash between the teal primary color and blue navigation highlight.

## Current Palette Analysis

The current website uses:

- **Primary (Teal)**: `#3a5f56` (hsl(158, 24%, 30%))
- **Primary Light**: `#7ed6b9` (hsl(158, 50%, 67%))
- **Accent (Blue)**: `#0089c7` (hsl(200, 100%, 39%))

**Issue**: The teal green primary color clashes with the blue navigation highlight, creating visual inconsistency when both colors are used for important UI elements like navigation highlights and CTA buttons.

## Palette Options

### Option 1: Blue Primary with Teal Accent

This palette pivots to make the blue your primary color for a cohesive experience:

```css
--primary: 200 100% 39%;     /* #0089c7 (current accent blue) */
--primary-light: 200 100% 65%; /* #4db8f5 (lighter blue) */
--accent: 158 50% 67%;       /* #7ed6b9 (current light teal as accent) */
```

**Rationale**: Since the blue is already working well for navigation highlights, this approach creates consistency by using it for all primary actions. The teal becomes a distinctive accent color that maintains brand connection to the original palette.

**Best for**: Photography that features cooler tones, water, sky, or urban environments. Blue conveys trust, professionalism, and tranquility.

### Option 2: Refined Teal with Blue Accent

This palette shifts the teal to be more blue-leaning, creating better harmony:

```css
--primary: 180 40% 35%;      /* #2d6b73 (a more blue-leaning teal) */
--primary-light: 180 40% 65%; /* #7bc2ca (lighter blue-teal) */
--accent: 200 100% 39%;      /* #0089c7 (current blue accent) */
```

**Rationale**: This maintains the teal as your primary color but shifts it to be more harmonious with the blue accent. The result is a cohesive palette with better color harmony while maintaining the teal brand identity.

**Best for**: Photography that features natural environments, especially where water meets land. This palette bridges natural and professional feels.

### Option 3: Monochromatic Blue with Teal Accent

--primary-light: 200 100% 39%; /* #0089c7 (current accent blue) */
--accent: 158 50% 67%;       /* #7ed6b9 (current light teal as accent) */
```

## Considerations for Photography Websites

When selecting a color palette for a photography website, consider:

1. **Let the photography shine**: The palette should enhance, not compete with, the photography. Neutral or muted colors often work best as the primary palette.

2. **Consider your subject matter**: Choose colors that complement your most common subjects. For example, warm tones for portraits, blues for landscapes with water, etc.

3. **Brand positioning**: Your color palette communicates your brand personality. Bold colors suggest creativity, neutrals suggest timelessness, blues suggest professionalism.

4. **Consistency across UI elements**: Ensure your primary color works well for all UI elements, especially buttons and navigation highlights.

5. **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors for readability.

6. **Color harmony**: Choose colors that work well together. Complementary colors (opposite on the color wheel) create energy, analogous colors (adjacent on the color wheel) create harmony.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis of your current website and the exploration of alternative palettes:

### Primary Recommendation: Blue Primary with Teal Accent (Option 1)

This option resolves the clash between the teal primary and blue navigation highlight by making the blue your primary color. It maintains connection to your original brand through the teal accent while creating a more cohesive user experience.

### Alternative Recommendation: Refined Teal with Blue Accent (Option 2)

If maintaining teal as your primary color is important for brand recognition, this option shifts the teal to be more harmonious with the blue accent, creating better color harmony while preserving the teal identity.

### Consider Your Photography Style

If your photography has a specific style or subject focus, consider:
- **Portrait-focused**: Warm Earthy (Option 4) or Sage and Gold (Option 7)
- **Editorial/Fashion**: Deep Moody (Option 6) or Elegant Plum (Option 9)
- **Landscape/Travel**: Coastal (Option 8) or Monochromatic Blue (Option 3)
- **Versatile/Mixed**: Sophisticated Neutral (Option 5)

## Implementation

To implement a new color palette, you'll need to update the CSS variables in your globals.css file:
