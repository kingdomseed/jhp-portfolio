# Jason Holt Photography Website Migration Notes

## Current Status

We've made significant progress in setting up the foundation for the new Jason Holt Photography website using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished and the challenges we've resolved:

### Completed Tasks

1. **Design System Setup**
   - Created a cohesive color palette based on teal and blue accent colors
   - Set up font pairing with Cormorant Garamond (headings) and Inter (body text)

   - Created mobile menu with slide-out drawer for mobile navigation
   - Built comprehensive site footer with navigation, services, and contact information
   - Set up site configuration in theme.ts for centralized management of navigation and services

3. **Pages**

     - Added "My Approach" section with philosophy cards
     - Integrated background blobs for visual interest
     - Ensured responsive design for all screen sizes
     - Used shadcn/ui Card components for consistent styling

4. **Technical Fixes**
   - Resolved compatibility issues between Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui by downgrading to stable versions
   - Downgraded Next.js from canary to stable version to improve reliability
   - Updated React to a stable version compatible with the rest of the stack
   - Fixed CSS application issues and Turbopack errors
   - Converted TypeScript configuration files to JavaScript for better compatibility

### Previous Challenges (Now Resolved)

We were facing some technical challenges with the development environment:

1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility**
   - The project was using Tailwind CSS v4.0.8, which is a very new version (alpha/beta)
   - There were compatibility issues between Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui
   - This was causing issues with the CSS not being applied correctly and Turbopack errors

2. **Next.js Canary Version**
   - The project was using Next.js 15.2.0-canary.68, which is a pre-release version
   - This was contributing to the stability issues we were experiencing

### Resolution

We have implemented the following changes to resolve the technical issues:

1. **Downgraded Tailwind CSS**
   - Changed from Tailwind CSS v4.0.8 (alpha) to v3.4.1 (latest stable v3.x)
   - Removed v4-specific dependencies like "@tailwindcss/cli" and "@tailwindcss/postcss"
   - Updated related packages like "tailwind-merge" to versions compatible with v3.x

2. **Downgraded Next.js**
   - Changed from Next.js 15.2.0-canary.68 to v14.1.0 (stable)
   - Updated the "eslint-config-next" to match the Next.js version
   - Removed the "--turbopack" flag from the dev script to use the standard Next.js development server

3. **Downgraded React**
   - Changed from React 19.0.0 to 18.2.0 (stable)
   - Updated React DOM to match
   - Updated React type definitions to match

4. **Resolved Dependency Conflicts**
   - Updated date-fns from v4.1.0 to v3.0.0 to resolve conflicts with react-day-picker
   - Updated eslint from v9.x to v8.56.0 to resolve conflicts with eslint-config-next

5. **Configuration Changes**
   - Converted next.config.ts to next.config.js for compatibility with Next.js v14.1.0

## Current Working State

The website is now in a stable working state:
- The development server runs without errors
- CSS is properly applied to all components
- The home page is fully functional with all sections displaying correctly
- Navigation works as expected
- Dark mode toggle functions properly
- Mobile menu is responsive

## Next Steps

Now that the technical issues are resolved, we can continue with the migration plan:

1. **Complete the Migration**
   - Implement the remaining pages (Services, Galleries, Bookings, Contact)
   - Add additional features (SEO optimization, performance optimization, analytics, accessibility)

2. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test the site thoroughly across different browsers and devices
   - Refine the design and user experience based on feedback
   - Optimize performance and accessibility

3. **Deployment**
   - Set up a production deployment pipeline
   - Configure domain and hosting
   - Implement monitoring and analytics

## Lessons Learned

1. **Stable Dependencies**
   - Using stable versions of dependencies is crucial for a production website
   - Alpha/beta versions can introduce unexpected compatibility issues
   - Ensure all dependencies are compatible with each other

2. **Configuration Compatibility**
   - Different versions of Next.js have different configuration requirements
   - TypeScript configuration files are not supported in all versions
   - Always check the documentation for the specific version being used

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Peer dependency conflicts can cause subtle issues
   - Using `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` can mask underlying problems
   - It's better to resolve conflicts by updating to compatible versions

## Conclusion

The migration to Next.js provides a solid foundation for a modern, performant, and maintainable website. The new stack offers significant advantages in terms of developer experience, performance, and scalability. The design system ensures a consistent and professional look and feel across the site, while the component-based architecture allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

With the technical issues now resolved, we can continue with the migration and create a comprehensive online presence for Jason Holt Photography that effectively showcases his work and converts visitors into clients.
