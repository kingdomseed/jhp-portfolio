## Adding New Images

### Step 1: Place Images in the Correct Directory
Images should be added to the `/public/images/` directory. The gallery supports various image formats:
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WebP (.webp)
- GIF (.gif)

```bash
# Example of copying images to the public/images folder
cp your-new-images/*.jpeg jhp-next/public/images/
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Image Metadata
After adding new images, you must run the metadata generator script to calculate aspect ratios:

```bash
cd jhp-next
npm run generate-image-metadata
```

This script:
- Scans all images in the `/public/images/` directory
- Calculates dimensions and aspect ratios for each image
- Generates `/public/image-metadata.json` with this information
- Automatically runs as part of the build process (`npm run build`)

### Step 3: Add Images to the Gallery Data
Open `/app/galleries/page.tsx` and locate the `galleryImages` object. Add your new images to the appropriate category:

```typescript
const galleryImages = {
  portraits: [
    // Existing images...
    { 
      src: "/images/your-new-image.jpeg", 
      alt: "Description of the image", 
      category: "portraits", 
      date: "2024-04-01", 
      location: "Frankfurt Studio" 
    },
  ],
  // Other categories...
};
```

Required properties for each image:
- `src`: Path to the image (relative to /public)
- `alt`: Descriptive text for accessibility
- `category`: The category this image belongs to
- `date`: Date of the photo (used for sorting)
- `location`: Where the photo was taken

## Aspect Ratio Handling

### Automatic Calculation
The aspect ratio calculation happens automatically:

1. **During Build**: When you run `npm run build`, the script `generate-image-metadata.js` calculates dimensions and aspect ratios for all images and stores them in `image-metadata.json`.

2. **During Runtime**: The `MasonryGrid` component loads this JSON file and uses the stored aspect ratios to correctly size each image.

3. **Fallback System**: If metadata isn't found for an image (e.g., newly added image without running the generator), the component uses smart fallbacks:
   - Category-based defaults (portraits: 0.8, headshots: 1.0, etc.)
   - Final fallback to 1.5 (standard landscape ratio)

### How Aspect Ratios Work
- In the masonry layout, the width is fixed based on columns
- Height is dynamically calculated using: `height = width / aspectRatio`
- This preserves the original proportions of each image
- Portrait images (taller than wide) will have aspect ratios < 1
- Landscape images (wider than tall) will have aspect ratios > 1
- Square images will have aspect ratio = 1

## Managing Image Categories

### Current Categories
The gallery currently supports these categories:
- `portraits`: Professional and artistic portraits
- `family`: Family photo sessions
- `engagements`: Engagement and couple sessions
- `events`: Event photography
- `creative`: Creative and artistic shots

### Adding a New Category

1. **Create the Category**: Add a new key to the `galleryImages` object in `/app/galleries/page.tsx`:

```typescript
const galleryImages = {
  // Existing categories...
  newCategory: [
    { 
      src: "/images/new-category1.jpeg", 
      alt: "First new category image", 
      category: "newCategory", 
      date: "2024-04-01", 
      location: "Location" 
    },
    // Add more images...
  ],
};
```

2. **Update DEFAULT_ASPECT_RATIOS**: Add the new category to the default aspect ratios in `/components/ui/masonry-grid.tsx`:

```typescript
const DEFAULT_ASPECT_RATIOS = {
  // Existing entries...
  'newCategory': 1.5, // Use an appropriate default for this type
  'default': 1.5
};
```

## Adjusting Gallery Layout

The gallery layout can be customized by modifying props passed to the `MasonryGrid` component in `/app/galleries/page.tsx`:

```typescript
<MasonryGrid 
  images={displayedImages}
  onImageClick={openLightbox}
  columns={3}       // Number of columns
  gap={8}           // Gap between images in pixels
/>
```

### Available Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `images` | Array | required | Array of image objects to display |
| `columns` | Number | 3 | Number of columns in desktop view |
| `gap` | Number | 16 | Space between images in pixels |
| `className` | String | "" | Additional CSS classes |
| `onImageClick` | Function | required | Handler when an image is clicked |

### Responsive Behavior

The grid automatically adjusts columns based on screen size:
- Mobile (< 640px): 1 column
- Small tablet (< 768px): 2 columns
- Large tablet/desktop (â‰¥ 1024px): Value from `columns` prop

To modify this behavior, edit the `handleResize` function in `/components/ui/masonry-grid.tsx`.

## Customizing the Gallery

### Image Hover Effects
The hover effect on gallery images can be customized in `/components/ui/masonry-grid.tsx`. Look for the `<div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t...">` section.

### Sorting Options
Sorting options are controlled by the `handleSortChange` function in `/app/galleries/page.tsx`. Current options are:
- `newest`: Sort by date (newest first)
- `oldest`: Sort by date (oldest first)
- `az`: Sort alphabetically by title
- `za`: Sort reverse alphabetically by title
- `popular`: Currently randomized (can be modified to use actual metrics)

To add a new sorting option:
1. Add the option to the `GalleryFilters` component
2. Add a case to the `switch` statement in the `useEffect` hook

### Loading More Images
The gallery loads 12 images initially and adds 8 more each time "Load More" is clicked. To change these values, modify these variables in `/components/ui/masonry-grid.tsx`:
- `const [visibleCount, setVisibleCount] = useState(12)`
- `setVisibleCount(prev => Math.min(prev + 8, images.length))`

## Troubleshooting

### Images Have Incorrect Dimensions

1. **Verify metadata generation**: Check if `/public/image-metadata.json` contains entries for your images
   ```bash
   cat jhp-next/public/image-metadata.json | grep "your-image-name"
   ```

2. **Regenerate metadata**: Run the generator script
   ```bash
   npm run generate-image-metadata
   ```

3. **Check console logs**: Look for "Loaded image metadata for gallery" in browser console

### New Category Not Showing

1. Ensure you've added the category to `DEFAULT_ASPECT_RATIOS` in `masonry-grid.tsx`
2. Verify the category name is consistent between `galleryImages` and where you assign it to images
3. Check that the filter tab for the new category appears in the UI

### General Performance Tips

1. **Optimize image sizes**: Pre-optimize images before adding them to the gallery
2. **Lazy loading**: The gallery already implements lazy loading with the "Load More" button
3. **Image dimensions**: Consider standardizing on common aspect ratios when shooting (helps with layout consistency)
