## Technical Issues Addressed

### Image Aspect Ratio Handling ✅

The image aspect ratio handling in the gallery has been successfully fixed. The implemented solution includes:

1. **Image Metadata Generation System**
   - An automated script (`scripts/generate-image-metadata.js`) that runs during build
   - Analyzes all images in `/public/images/` to calculate dimensions and aspect ratios
   - Generates a `/public/image-metadata.json` file with this information

2. **True Masonry Layout Algorithm**
   - Replaced the fixed-height row approach with a column-based masonry layout
   - Images are placed in the shortest column first
   - Height is calculated dynamically based on width and aspect ratio
   - Preserves the original proportions of each image

3. **Robust Fallback System**
   - If metadata for an image is missing, falls back to category-based defaults
   - Portrait images default to 0.8 ratio, squares to 1.0, landscapes to 1.5
   - Final fallback to a standard 1.5 aspect ratio

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Automatically adjusts column count based on screen size
   - Maintains image proportions across all devices
   - Smooth transitions between layout states

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation in `GALLERY-DOCUMENTATION.md`
   - Added quick reference guide in `GALLERY-QUICK-REFERENCE.md`
   - Memory bank updated with system architecture details

### TidyCal API Integration Improvements ✅

The TidyCal integration has been significantly improved with the following changes:

1. Fixed CORS issues by implementing server-side API routes
2. Created a proper client/server architecture for TidyCal API communication
3. Improved error handling and debugging for API requests
4. Removed "Discovery Call" as a service type (it's a post-selection screening call)
5. Enhanced the booking calendar component with better error states

These improvements provide a more robust and secure way to interact with the TidyCal API, avoiding CORS issues and improving the overall reliability of the booking system.

## Conclusion

The Jason Holt Photography website has successfully migrated to Next.js, providing a solid foundation for a modern, performant, and maintainable website. The implementation of the design system, core components, and main pages has created a cohesive and visually appealing experience.

Recent improvements to the gallery system have resolved the aspect ratio handling issues, creating a professional and visually appealing presentation of photography work. The masonry grid now correctly preserves image proportions, with smart fallbacks ensuring consistent display even for images without metadata.

The TidyCal integration has been significantly enhanced with server-side API routes resolving previous CORS issues, creating a more robust architecture for handling external API calls.

For the next phase of development, the focus should be on:

1. **Content Migration & Verification**: Ensuring all content is accurate before final launch

5. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Adding proper ARIA attributes and fixing screen reader issues 
6. **Content Strategy**: Developing blog content and enhancing service descriptions

By continuing to follow this detailed implementation plan, the website will evolve into a powerful marketing tool that effectively showcases Jason's photography services and converts visitors into clients.
